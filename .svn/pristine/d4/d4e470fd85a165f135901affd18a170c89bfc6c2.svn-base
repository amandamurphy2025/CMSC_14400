2A. 
Data from x[0] and x[1] will use same cache line because 128 * 4 = 512, which is the cache size. Therefore, miss rate is 100%.

2B.
Now, entire array fits in the cache: 128 * 4 * 2 = 1024.  Cold misses for each block define miss rate.  Each block holds 4 items: 16 bytes per block / 4 bytes per int.  1 out of every 4 is a miss, therefore miss rate is 25%.

2C. 
No more conflict misses.  Therefore, miss rate is 25% from the cold misses upon loading blocks.

2D.
No, the miss rate would stay the same.  Each cache block needs to be loaded and there are misses here no matter what.

2E.
Yes, the cold misses are calculated by how many items are in each block.  Right now it is 1 out of 4, but if it was 1 out of X, where X is bigger than 4, the miss rate would reduce to 1/X.
