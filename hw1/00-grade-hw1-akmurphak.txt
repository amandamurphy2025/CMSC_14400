Graded files from svn revision 6

--------------------------------------
Question 1 points and comments: 3/14

1A - partially correct - the mode is Indirect
1B - wrong - the *memory address* is in fact 0x222 (base + displacement mode), but we cannot determine the value at this address because we don't know the *endianness*
1C - wrong - 560 is Absolute mode, the memory address 0x230, which has value 0x54
1D - wrong - the mode is Indexed, so the *value* at address 0x218 is 0xBC
1E - wrong - the mode is Scaled Indexed, so the *value* at address 0x228 is 0x42
1F - correct
1G - wrong - the mode is Scaled Indexed, so the *value* at address 0x230 is 0x54

Question 2 points and comments: 17/20
2E - incorrect value. when applying bitwise not to 0x1, all bits will be one except the last one (so our string should end in an E). Also remember that q signifies a 64-bit number
2H - incorrect value. this should be 0xBC00
2J - incorrect value. this should be 0x2A. be careful when converting from hex to binary and back!
